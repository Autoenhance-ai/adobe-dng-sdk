Adobe® DNG SDK 1.1 Read Me

Introduction
The DNG SDK provides support for reading and writing DNG files as well as support for converting DNG data into a format easily displayed or processed by imaging applications. This SDK can serve as a starting point for adding DNG support to existing applications that use and manipulate images or as an aid to adding DNG support within cameras.
