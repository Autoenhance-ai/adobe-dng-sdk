/* Values of BUILDDATE, BUILDBRANCH, BUILDID, RE_REBUILD, and RELEASECL fields to be filled by RE only
   
a)	BUILDDATE
RE will update the BUILDDATE field for every build. The BUILDDATE string will have the following format:				<year>/<month>/<day>-<hour>:<min>:<sec>
i.e.: YYYY/MM/DD-HH:MM:SS

b)	BUILDID 
This field is a number that will be used to identify a "matching set" of CoreTech libraries. The BUILDID will be identical for all CoreTech components built in a particular build cycle e.g.: All builds started in the same RE cycle on the mainline might be assigned a BUILDID of 1234. For each CoreTech Release Engineering build cycle, RE would increment the current BUILDID. So, no two builds of the same library will have the same BUILDID. However, the BUILID will not be incremented for any rebuilds.

c)	RE_BUILDID
This field stands for Releng Rebuild id. For the initial build the value is empty ,i.e. "". As mentioned above, in case of a rebuild due to issues such as bad unix builds, build failures, etc, RE will not update the BUILDID field but will rather update the RE_REBUILD field. Each rebuild is assigned a single letter starting with "a", then "b", etc.

d)	BUILDBRANCH 
RE will set the branch ID value in BUILDBRANCH. E.g.: For the kimi branch, the BUILDBRANCH will be 44. For normajean, BUILDBRANCH will be 49.

e)	BUILDCHANGELIST 
RE will set this field to changelist value representing the top Perforce changelist on the originating depot i.e. Alaska:1700
